#### Softwares
---
The software that were used are:
1. Visual Studio Code for coding
2. Docker to simplify development process
3. Qemu to emulate OS
4. NASM, grub, and GCC-cross-x86_64-elf used by docker to simplify its implementation. 
#### Set Up Image
---
The commands that I used are as follows:
- To build the docker image 
`docker build buildenv -t myos-buildenv`
#### Build
---
- After that spin up this image as a container. I was using windows so used this command
Windows (CMD): `docker run --rm -it -v "%cd%":/root/env myos-buildenv`
- Then used build command 
`make build-x86_64`
#### Image
---
- And emulated it with Qemu
`"C:\Program Files\qemu\qemu-system-x86_64" -cdrom dist/x86_64/kernel.iso`
